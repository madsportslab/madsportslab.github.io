Be sure to vote for your favorite NBA All-Stars at [http://nba.com/vote](http://nba.com/vote).  Here are my votes for this year's starting five:

Position | Western Conference All-Stars | Eastern Conference All-Stars
--- | --- | ---
C | Anthony Davis | Joel Embiid
PF | Lebron James | Giannis Antetokounmpo
SF | Kevin Durant | Kawhi Leonard
SG | James Harden | Victor Oladipo
PG | Stephen Curry | Kyrie Irving

The voting is a simple process for me, I vote for the top players in their respective positions, the only borderline case is Anthony Davis since his true position is power forward, but he plays the center position quite well and I don't think there's a center in the NBA, arguably, that's better than AD anyway.  There are several factors that come into play here for choosing the _best_ players in their positions, obviously I didn't go just by statistics because Kemba Walker is averaging 25.4 points, 6.0 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game, but he didn't make my top 5 partially because Walker's playing for a really bad Charlotte Hornets team with a losing record.  Bradley Beal's a similar case to Walker, he's averaging 23.6 points, 4.7 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per game, but on a losing Washington Wizards team.  Overall both players are excellent players at their positions, but if I were to swap say Bradley Beal onto the Boston Celtics for Kyrie Irving, there's no way Beal could carry that team to the finals, Kyrie also has a championship and game winning championship shot to boot.

In terms of team make up, I would say that my Eastern Conference team, relatively speaking, lacks shooting, Curry, Harden, and Durant on one team is a formidable offensive threat, so if placing a sharp shooter like Bradley Beal into the Shooting Guard position instead of Oladipo, this could be a slightly better balance, but Oladipo is having another great season, leading the Pacers to 3rd rank in the East.  At the end of the day, the format for the NBA All-Star game will have 2 captains decide the team's roster, so the above list is mere formality.

Some other honorable mentions, Paul George, one of my favorite players, is having a stellar season averaging a career high 26.7 points, 4.1 assists, 8.1 rebounds per game while defending the top one-two players on the opposing team each night, Damion Lillard, Devin Booker, Blake Griffin, DeMar DeRozan, Klay Thompson, Jrue Holiday, Russell Westbrook, etc.

## MVP Talk

MVP voting is done by the media, the last three winners are James Harden (2017-18), Russell Westbrook (2016-17), and Stephen Curry (2015-16).  Like the All-Star voting process, the votes could be somewhat arbitrary, not everyone uses the same metrics of measurement, but typically average points plays a large factor, assists, rebounds, records set in a season like most three pointers or most triple doubles, team record, etc.  Typically players that pad statistics, but don't help their teams win, do not get the award, take Carmelo Anthony in the 2012-13 season was scoring champion averaging 28.7 points per game, but the MVP was won by Lebron James playing for the Miami Heat.  From my perspective, I typically like to think of the MVP from this perspective, if you pooled all the NBA players together into a draft, and you had the first pick, who would you choose?  Typically I like two-way players that can defend and score, players like Stephen Curry and Harden would be lower on the list, so Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis come to mind.  The 2004-05 MVP was Steve Nash and Shaquille O'Neal, until this day, thinks this was one of the biggest mistakes ever made, Shaq was averaging 22.9 points, 10.4 rebounds, 2.3 blocks, with a 60.1% field goal percentage, and took his team to the conference finals, Steve Nash averaged 15.5 points, 11.5 assists, 3.3 rebounds per game, but the Phoenix Suns finished the season with the best record at 62-20.

This season is still early, but I Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Stephen Curry are all playing quite well.

## Max Contracts

Last year there were several maximum contracts given, Russell Westbrook $205M/6 years, John Wall $170M/4 years, Chris Paul $160M/4 years,  Paul George $137M/4 years.  Paul George is already having a career year and Westbrook is continuing to produce, but let's analyze Chris Paul and John Wall.

Chris Paul is age 33, typically the best years of NBA players where they're at top health and experience are from age 26-34, so this contract really baffles me.  During the playoffs last year against Golden State, admittedly Chris Paul played a huge role in their almost ouster of the Golden State Warriors, but the beginning of this year for Houston was awful as the Rockets were pretty much near the bottom of the Western Conference with a losing record.  Recently he re-injured his oft-injured hamstring and he's out for another long string of games, but surprisingly the Rockets are playing much better without him.  This season Paul's averaging 15.6 points, 8.0 assists, and 4.0 rebounds per game which is not bad, but it wasn't translating into wins.

John Wall continues to pull up great statistics averaging 20.7 points, 8.7 assists, and 3.6 rebounds per game, but the Wizards are also not winning games.  About a few weeks into the season, the Wizards' management went public stating things weren't working and all players were available for trade discussions including John Wall and Bradley Beal.  Wall has a history of injuries, like Chris Paul, last year he missed a large portion of the season close to the playoffs.  But after management publicly announced the need for change on the Wizards' roster, Wall announced that he will undergo season ending surgery on his heel and achilles tendon, this means that most teams won't want John Wall because he has no immediate value for the current season and there's risk that Wall comes back a different or worse player after the injury.  The timing of this announcement is suspicious, players play with injuries all the time, some minor, but this announcement pretty much solidifies that he will not be traded.

These types of contracts strangle a team's ability to succeed, the goal for these contracts obviously is to keep players motivated and other teams from poaching their talent, but when you have a situation where someone doesn't cooperate or doesn't have the team's best interests in his mind, then this becomes a long term problem that's hard to fix.
