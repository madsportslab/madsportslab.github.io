The OKC Thunder are surprisingly at the top of the ultra deep Western Conference at 21-10.  Denver and Golden State share the top spot which is no surprise despite all their respective injuries.  But the Thunder sharing first place with those two teams is really beyond me, so what exactly makes these Thunder so good?  Has the competition declined, do they have an incredibly easy schedule, did they make some awesome trades, did they draft really, really well, are Westbrook and George really that good, or is Billy Donovan really an NBA caliber top coach?  Let's break this down and try to understand the reality of the Thunder this season.

Here are the Thunder's trades this season:

Traded/Released | Acquired/Drafted
--- | ---
Carmelo Anthony, Josh Huestis, Kyle Singler, Nick Collison, Corey Brewer, Dakari Johnson, Daniel Hamilton, PJ Dozier  | Dennis Schroder, Nerlens Noel, Hamidou Diallo, Deonte Burton, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Abdel Nader, Tyler Davis

Overall there aren't a lot of big names like Kawhi Leonard or Lebron James, but this is a massive amount of activity, this to me a re-haul of large portions of the roster from 2017.  Kyle Singler and Nick Collison have been long time players on the bench for the Thunder, to release them has given the Thunder the ability to get younger and more athletic.

The biggest trade of this bunch is in acquiring Dennis Schroder, Schroder's a legitimate starting point guard in the NBA, put him on any other team in the NBA and he can probably start, but because of the Westbrook dynamic, Schroder has to sit the bench for OKC.  There are times that the two play together even though Schroder can play off the ball at times, but he's not a terribly great spot up shooter and his 3 point shot could improve.  Schroder is listed at 6'1" which is not that tall, but he has excellent arm length, reads the floor well, and has pretty high basketball IQ which allows him to be an excellent defender in that package.  When he plays with the ball in his hands, he can make plays and probably becomes a number 3 or 4 option that can create something, sometimes behind or in front of Steven Adams.  Generally a great pickup and I have to say that his personality and selflessness really fits well with the Thunder core, this was a great pickup for the Thunder, but definitely not someone that was going to push them over Golden State.

Ridding themselves of the Carmelo Anthony _curse_ definitely freed up some things for the Thunder, last year it always felt like Westbrook and George were trying too hard to let Anthony fit, but Anthony's style was truly a drag on what the Thunder really wanted to implement which is a defensive minded team that can run with the ball, play iso, or even space and pace.  Anthony played significant minutes and started most games while on the Thunder, but when it came down to crunch time, Coach Donovan put Anthony on the bench against the Utah Jazz during the playoffs.

Nerlens Noel was a decent free agent pickup, the big man was the 6th pick of the 2013 draft and had high expectations to dominate the NBA, at least from a defensive perspective, but he fell will to the Philadelphia 76ers' injury laden, high draft pick melodrama.  He played stints for Philadelphia and Dallas, but didn't end up doing anything significant.  For the Thunder, Noel adds a defensive minded big man that can rebound, block, or alter the shots for any small Curry's trying to smoke past Westbrook and George.  I'm quite surprised by his offense, Noel is shooting 57.7% from the field, mostly dunks and close range shots, but still, he wasn't known as an offensive weapon so averaging 5.2 points a game is stellar!  This position of power forward and center was definitely a gap in the Thunder lineup, Adams definitely starts, but after that it was sometimes Jerami Grant or Patrick Patterson at the 5, Dakari Johnson, or Nick Collison, not very effective for the Thunder, so Noel legitimizes the 4 and 5 backup spots for the Thunder.

Hamidou Diallo was the number 15th pick in the first round of last year's draft, I really like this guy, he's a super athletic wing or shooting guard, has speed, great footwork, some major ups, isn't afraid to score (mostly dunks), and major upside on defense.  He's about the same size as Terrance Ferguson and Josh Huestis from last year, lanky, long arms, slim, and fast.  But Diallo has a bit more confidence and ability to create on the offensive side, he is an excellent cutter.  I actually was a fan of Huestis, but he never lived up to his potential, he had just as good athleticism as Diallo, but his decision making wasn't good, Huestis mostly ended up being a poor spot up 3 point shooter, occasionally had a rebound jam, but couldn't defend anyone.  Diallo can defend with the best of them.  I'm sure Paul George is also bringing the youngsters along with his philosophy of clamping down on defense, focusing on defense and slowly building up an offensive game.

Overall there weren't a lot of huge needle movers from trades this season for Thunder, these are all incremental at best, but definitely an upgrade over last year.  The schedule for OKC has been pretty challenging, the Western Conference is still dominant with the second to last place team only 7.5 games behind the Thunder.  So I wouldn't accredit the Thunder's good fortune to a weak schedule.
  
Westbrook was injured for several games earlier this season and has performed relatively poorly, but he still gets his triple doubles from time to time.  He's averaging a triple double thus far with 20.1 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 10.3 assists per game, but his shooting percentage is dragging this year at 42.3% and 23.6% from 3 point range.

Paul George is having a monster of a season, in his third year back after a gruesome leg injury, and with him seemingly gelling with his teammates even more, George is averaging a career high 26.1 points per game, attempting a career high 8.8 three pointers a game and making 38.6% of them.  He still leads the NBA in steals with 2.2 per game and can be seen defending the league's top players almost every night.  George has hit several last second game winners and seems to be clutch down the stretch sometimes exploding for 15+ points a quarter, he is having an MVP caliber season thus far.

Jerami Grant and Steven Adams continue to improve and provide defense, dunks, and offensive rebounds.  Grant has been steadily improving from an offensive perspective averaging 12.3 points per game.  Adams is a monster averaging a double double per game at 16.2 points and 10.2 rebounds, but these are similar levels to his previous year.

Last year, the Thunder had long stretches where they couldn't win games, they would lose 8-9 in a row, then blowout Golden State at Oracle Arena the next game, they were really inconsistent and I think it had to do with their roster, Carmelo was a drag on the team's defense and speed, Raymond Felton, although pretty solid offensively and defensively, was their backup point guard, but now you see Schroder step in to the point where you rarely see Felton on the floor.  Patrick Patterson also saw a lot of playing time last year, but you rarely see him on the floor.  Overall the Thunder are just clicking together as a team, George is having a phenomenal year, and all the players are stepping up, from new to old players.  And just think, defensive juggernaut, Andre Roberson, has been hurt all year long, when they get him back, and if things are clicking like this, the Thunder could be a very dangerous team.  I still don't think the Thunder are in reach of a championship, but a piece or two away, very close.
