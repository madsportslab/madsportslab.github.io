The OKC Thunder are surprisingly at the top of the ultra deep Western Conference at 21-10.  Denver and Golden State share the top spot which is no surprise despite all their respective injuries.  But the Thunder sharing first place with those two teams is really unexpected, so what exactly makes these Thunder so good?  Has the competition declined, do they have an incredibly easy schedule, did they make some awesome trades, did they draft really, really well, are Westbrook and George really that good, or is Billy Donovan really an NBA caliber top coach?  Let's break this down and try to understand the reality of the Thunder this season.

Here are the Thunder's trades this season:

## Traded/Released

* Carmelo Anthony
* Josh Huestis
* Kyle Singler
* Nick Collison
* Corey Brewer
* Dakari Johnson
* Daniel Hamilton
* PJ Dozier

## Acquired/Drafted

* Dennis Schroder
* Nerlens Noel
* Hamidou Diallo
* Deonte Burton
* Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot
* Abdel Nader
* Tyler Davis


Overall there aren't a lot of big names like Kawhi Leonard or Lebron James in these lists, but this is a massive amount of activity, 8 total players traded, 7 added, to me this a re-haul of large portions of the roster from 2017.  Kyle Singler and Nick Collison had been long time players on the bench for the Thunder, to release them has given the Thunder the ability to get younger and more athletic, I imagine Sam Presti was rewarding these players for being loyal all these years, but it was finally time to move on.

The biggest trade of this bunch was in acquiring Dennis Schroder, Schroder's a legitimate starting point guard in the NBA, put him on any other team in the NBA and he can probably start, but because of the Westbrook dynamic, Schroder has to sit the bench for OKC.  There are times that the two play together even though Schroder can play off the ball at times, but he's not a terribly great spot up shooter and his 3 point shot could improve.  Schroder is listed at 6'1" which is not that tall, but he has excellent arm length, reads the floor well, and has pretty high basketball IQ which allows him to be an excellent defender in that form factor.  When he plays with the ball in his hands, he can make plays and probably becomes a number 3 or 4 option that can create something, sometimes he's a better option than Steven Adams because of his range and mobility.  Generally a great pickup and I have to say that his personality and selflessness really fits well with the Thunder core, this was a great pickup for the Thunder, but definitely not someone that was going to push them over Golden State.

Ridding themselves of the Carmelo Anthony _curse_ definitely freed up some things for the Thunder, last year it always felt like Westbrook and George were trying too hard to let Anthony fit, but Anthony's style was truly a drag on what the Thunder really wanted to implement which is a defensive minded team that can run with the ball, space and pace, and iso.  Anthony played significant minutes and started most games while on the Thunder, but when it came down to crunch time, Coach Donovan put Anthony on the bench against the Utah Jazz during the playoffs.  There was a roster logjam at the small forward position for George and Anthony, Anthony started at power forward, but couldn't really defend much larger or taller/faster players like Aldridge or Draymond Green, and often power forwards would have to swap on and off with centers, there's no way Carmelo could hope to contain someone like Clint Capella, that's just too much to handle.  So Carmelo was a large handicap for the Thunder, he had to start, he couldn't really play power forward, couldn't defend, and wasn't helping to move the offense around.

Nerlens Noel was a decent free agent pickup, the big man was the 6th pick of the 2013 draft and had high expectations to dominate the NBA, at least from a defensive perspective, but he fell to the Philadelphia 76ers' injury laden, high draft pick curse.  He played stints for Philadelphia and Dallas, but didn't end up doing anything significant.  For the Thunder, Noel adds a defensive minded big man that can rebound, block, or alter the shots for any guards trying to smoke past Westbrook and George.  I'm quite surprised by his offense, Noel is shooting 57.7% from the field, mostly dunks and close range shots, but still, he wasn't known as an offensive weapon so averaging 5.2 points a game is stellar!  This position of power forward and center was definitely a gap in the Thunder lineup, Adams definitely starts at center, but after that it was sometimes Jerami Grant or Patrick Patterson at the 5, Dakari Johnson, or Nick Collison, not very effective for the Thunder, so Noel legitimizes the 4 and 5 backup spots for the Thunder.  Noel also seems to bring very positive energy to the team and fits in well.

Hamidou Diallo was the number 15th pick in the first round of last year's draft, I really like this guy, he's a super athletic wing or shooting guard, has speed, great footwork, some major ups, isn't afraid to score (mostly dunks), and major upside on defense.  He's about the same size as Terrance Ferguson and Josh Huestis from last year, lanky, long arms, slim, and fast, he's probably a bit stronger in the upper half than Ferguson and Huestis.  But Diallo has a bit more confidence and ability to create on the offensive side, he is an excellent cutter.  I actually was a fan of Huestis, but he never lived up to his potential, he had just as good athleticism as Diallo, but his decision making wasn't good, Huestis mostly ended up being a poor spot up 3 point shooter, occasionally had a rebound jam, but couldn't defend anyone.  Diallo can defend with the best of them.  I'm sure Paul George is also bringing the youngsters along with his philosophy of clamping down on defense, focusing first and foremost on defense and slowly building up an offensive game.
  
Westbrook was injured for several games earlier this season and has performed relatively poorly, but he still gets his triple doubles from time to time, thus far he's averaging a triple double with 20.1 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 10.3 assists per game, but his shooting percentage is dragging this year at 42.3% and 23.6% from 3 point range.  Westbrook has put up a lot fewer mid-range jump shots this year which is in general a pretty low percentage shot, you might as well take a step back and try for a 3 pointer instead with about the same percentage.  His main scoring punch is driving into the paint which causes lots of wear and tear on his body and the occasional 3 pointer.  I still think he needs to develop his outside shooting in order for him to be most effective.  On the defensive end, Westbrook is still a monster, typically bigger than most guards.  Often times I see him switching on pick and roll defense to take on centers like Gobert.

Paul George is having a monster of a season, in his third year back after a gruesome leg injury, and with him seemingly gelling with his teammates even more, George is averaging a career high 26.1 points per game, attempting a career high 8.8 three pointers a game and making 38.6% of them.  He still leads the NBA in steals with 2.2 per game and can be seen defending the league's top players almost every night.  George has hit several last second game winners and seems to be clutch down the stretch sometimes exploding for 15+ points a quarter, he is having an MVP caliber season thus far.  He has benefited the most from Carmelo leaving the team, I assume his leg is getting stronger, I can only imagine the leg muscles atrophying after all the time spent resting from a broken leg, he also doesn't seem to be as winded as previous seasons, his energy's back.

Jerami Grant and Steven Adams continue to improve and provide defense, dunks, and offensive rebounds.  Grant has improved a lot especially from an offensive perspective averaging 12.3 points per game, he has also gained from Carmelo leaving the team.  Adams has been a monster averaging a double double per game at 16.2 points and 10.2 rebounds, but these are similar levels to his previous year, he's often times seen getting offensive rebounds and his half hook shot/floater is getting more consistent.

As for the schedule, the Western Conference is still dominant with the second to last place team only separated by 7.5 games from the top, so I wouldn't accredit the Thunder's good fortune to a weak schedule.  They have a pretty even amount of home and away games, sometimes teams schedule a ton of home games where they can rest more and recover in the beginning and then you seem them suffer on the road mostly during the second half of the season, but OKC has been pretty even in terms of travel.

Overall there weren't a lot of huge needle movers from trades this season for Thunder, these are all incremental at best, but definitely an upgrade over last year, the starting five basically had no change, the trades did help to bolster the bench for sure.  Players that were once second team, like Felton, Patterson, and Abrines, now play behind Schroder, Noel, Abrines, and Diallo.  The trades also shed a lot of age from the roster, this has helped make the Thunder more athletic and younger.

Last year, the Thunder had long stretches where they couldn't win games, they would lose 8-9 in a row, then blowout Golden State at Oracle Arena the next game, they were really inconsistent and I think it had to do with their roster, Carmelo was a drag on the team's defense and speed, Raymond Felton, although pretty solid offensively and defensively, was their backup point guard, but now you see Schroder step in to the point where you rarely see Felton on the floor.  Patrick Patterson also saw a lot of playing time last year, but you rarely see him on the floor this season.  Overall the Thunder are just clicking together as a team, George is having a phenomenal year, and all the players are stepping up, from new to old players.  And just think, defensive juggernaut, Andre Roberson, has been hurt all year long, when he comes back, and if things are clicking like this, the Thunder could be a very dangerous team.  Roberson is the Ariza of the Thunder, look where the Rockets are now without Ariza on the floor, absolutely no defense, they are barely staying in contention for the 8th spot in the Western Conference so defense still makes a great deal.  I still don't think the Thunder are in reach of a championship, but are a close one or two pieces away.  This year it's exciting to watch the Thunder, a total reverse from last year, it was frustrating as a fan of the Thunder last year, they were just getting beat by some bad teams, but this year they're winning the games that they should win and losing close games to some tough opponents.
